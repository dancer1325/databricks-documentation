  * how does it work?
    * generative AI + data lakehouse
    * connecting ALL your sources of data -- to -- Databricks platform / apply solutions ([BI, generative AI])
  * uses 
    * understand the unique semantics -- of -- YOUR data
    * automatically 
      * optimizes performance
      * manages infrastructure / -- match your -- business needs

* Azure Databricks == Databricks | Azure
  * Azure Databricks platform architecture == 
    * infrastructure / used by Azure Databricks
      * allows, about the platform and services
        * deploy,
        * configure,
        * manage 
    * customer-owned infrastructure / managed by Azure Databricks + your company
  * requirements
    * ðŸ‘€NOT force you to migrate your data | proprietary storage systems ðŸ‘€
    * configure an Azure Databricks workspace / secure integrations between Azure Databricks platform -- & -- your cloud account
  * how does it work?
    * Azure Databricks -- via your account's cloud resources -- deploys compute clusters /
      * process
      * store data | object storage & other integrated services | your control
  * use cases
    * == # of data processed & employees
    * build an enterprise data lakehouse

* data lakehouse
  * == enterprise data warehouses + data lakes
  * allows, about enterprise data solutions / distributed,
    * accelerate, 
    * simplify (building, maintaining, and syncing) 
    * unify
  * uses
    * single source of truth for
      * Data engineers,
      * data scientists,
      * analysts,
      * production systems

* Unity Catalog
  * extends the relationship, Azure Databricks -- & -- your account
    * _Example:_ access data -- via -- familiar SQL syntax

* Natural language
  * processing
    * learns your businessâ€™s language / asking a question | your own words -> you can
      * search data
      * discover data
  * assistance helps you
    * write code,
    * troubleshoot errors,
    * find answers | documentation
