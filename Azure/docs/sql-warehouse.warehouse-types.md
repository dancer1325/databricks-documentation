* TODO:


* Serverless SQL warehouses
  * advantages over pro & classic models
    * instant and elastic compute
      * instant
        * Reason: ðŸ§  NO need to wait for infrastructure resources ðŸ§  
      * elastic
        * == workload management / dynamically handles scaling
        * -> avoid over-provisioning resource  | usage spikes.
    * TODO: Minimal management overhead: 
      * Capacity management, patching, upgrades, and performance optimization are all handled by Azure Databricks, simplifying operations and leading to predictable pricing.
    * Lower total cost of ownership (TCO):
      * Automatic provisioning and scaling of resources as needed helps avoid over-provisioning and reduces idle times, thus lowering TCO.
